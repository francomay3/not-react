# not-react

this is an attempt to creating a simple inplementation of a JSX syntax application that does not use React as a dependency.

the experiment is succcessful, so I know it is possible. debbuging is a bit of a pain though. next step would be to create some kind of state management system and possible find a solution to the debbuging issue.

also, it would be awesome to have this working with typescript.

many ideas, but for now im just happy with the result.

## how to use

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

modify App.jsx and run `npm run build` again to see the changes.
